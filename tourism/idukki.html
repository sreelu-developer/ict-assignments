Idukki (ഇടുക്കി)is a district in the Indian state of Kerala. It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala.

Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population density among the other districts of Kerala,[4] the urban population being higher than the rural. Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".

Till 1998, when Kuttampuzha was added to Ernakulam district, Idukki was the largest district in Kerala.

    <p class="card-text">
Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge  - Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India. One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete with resorts and logding facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m.

    <p class="card-text">
A parabolic marvel, aloft at 550 ft and spread out over 650 ft, greets visitors at the Kuravan and Kurathi Hills in Idukki. You have now reached the Idukki Arch Dam, the second in the world and first of its kind in all of Asia. The sight itself is awe-inspiring, considering the sheer magnitude of the structure and the purpose it serves. Nearby lies the Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary where one can seek solace in nature.

    <p class="card-text">

How often have you visited a national park in the background of tea plantations? Here is one such national park in the high ranges of Kerala which offers the magnificent view of hills with tea plantations - the Eravikulam National Park. Situated in the Kannan Devan Hills of the southern Western Ghats, the wildlife park with an area of 97 sq. km. can be reached via Munnar. Located in the Devikulam Taluk of Idukki district in Kerala, after reaching Munnar, you need to take the road going to Rajamala to reach this national park. 

The national park is a protected area and is divided into three regions - the core area, the buffer area and the tourism area. Visitors are allowed only to the tourism area that is in Rajamala, the region lying beyond the road entry into Eravikulam. Eravikulam is also famous for the natural habitat of Nilgiri Tahr, the endangered mountain goat and this park is built with the aim of conserving them.  

Every twelve years, this place will be carpeted with blue… Yes, your guess is correct. It is one the place where you can witness the mass flowering of Neelakurinji flowers.
