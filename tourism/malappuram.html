    <p class="card-text">
Kerala has had a long association with teak and has always played a central role in its cultivation and trade. The word teak itself is said to have come from the Malayalam word 'theku'. The Teak Museum in Nilambur celebrates this ancient relationship and takes one on a special journey through history, chronicling teak and its importance in our culture.

Teak is still the most sought after form of timber. The museum was made of the sub-centre of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) in 1995. Teak is extremely significant in the area. The world's first Teak (Tectonagrandis) plantation was raised in Nilambur way back in the 1840s and is among the premier teak plantations in the world. 
Visitors come here in large numbers and are greeted by the extensive root system of a 55-year-old teak tree in the portico.

	Far away from the chaos of city life in the outskirts of Malappuram district lies the delightful area of Ponnani, renowned for its ancient religious shrines, serene beaches, and calm and composed hamlets. 
Ponnani has a vibe unique even to God’s Own Country. It resembles a river flowing to the tunes of a long lost Sufi song. Everything seems to be so melodious, and the rhythm of the site engulfs all who visit it.

    <h5 class="card-title">Paloor Kotta Water fall</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
A lesser-known jewel in Malappuram district, Paloor Kotta waterfalls is the dream of any traveller. 
This gorgeous two-decker waterfall flaunts a magnificent drop amidst a verdant landscape. 
It is secluded deep in the woods, and the leap of the waters offers all the drama in the forest. It is not just a natural wonderland, rather, the place has something to offer history enthusiasts as well.
Paloor Kotta Falls is a waterfall in Kadungapuram village in Malappuram district, Kerala. Although the place goes by the name Paloor Kotta (Kotta meaning “fort” in local parlance) there is no fort here. History has it that the legendary ruler Tipu Sultan took refuge here. While there isn't any artificial structure, the place resembles a fortification made by Nature herself! A good vantage point is offered here at the waterfalls. This could be the reason why Tipu Sultan decided to seek refuge here while hiding from his enemies. 
The place is believed to have served him as effectively as any strong fort.
