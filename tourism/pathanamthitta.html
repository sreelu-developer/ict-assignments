    <h5 class="card-title">Thriveni Sangamam </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
Situated on the way to Sabarimala, the Thriveni Sangamam as the name suggests is the point where the Holy Pamba River meets with the Manimala River in its north and with the Achankovil River in the south. The devotees stop here to take a dip in the holy water to wash away their sins. Millions of visitors also come here to enjoy the beautiful landscape of the place. The Pamba River, also known as the Dakshina Ganga or the Ganges of South India, is the third longest river in the southern part of the country which begins flowing from the Western Ghats. Devotees believe that it was near this holy river that King Rajasekara gained a vision of Lord Ayappa.

Considered as pure as the Ganges, the water of the Pamba River can purify the evil and lift the curse which is why it is deemed to be lucky for all the pilgrims to take a dip in the river before and after trekking the Sabarimala. Triveni Sanganam is a beautiful place which is visited by thousands of devotees every year not only to sanctify themselves in the holy water but also to enjoy the scenic beauty of the place with the natural surroundings.
