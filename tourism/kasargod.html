    <h5 class="card-title">Bekal Fort</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Bekal Fort was built by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi in 1650 AD, at Bekal. It is the largest fort in Kerala,
	spreading over 40 acres
	The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.
	An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.
Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad,
 Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Kappil Beach, Kasaragod
Beaches are about feeling one’s own heart beat frantically as a mighty being pulsates right in front of us.
 The ebbs and flows of our existence become one with sea, and that is why the few who make the trip to Kappil Beach, 
 swear by it at all times. It is famous for its seclusion and rightly so. Large spaces of pristine sand and a divine water body 
 in front with no other disturbance whatsoever is something people seek in growing numbers these days. Among the finest and cleanest beaches in God’s Own Country, 
this is a destination perfect for those who seek solitude and a place to face their own selves in peace.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Ranipuram</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
Ranipuram is a renowned tourist destination in the northern tip of Kerala. Located in Kasaragod, 
it is situated 750 m above sea level. It makes for a perfect picnic spot where one can even come across the occasional herd 
of elephants. Once known as Madathumala, it borders Karnataka and boasts of some of the best trekking trails in the area. Regular buses are available on this route and jeep rides are another favourite 
among all our visitors. The versatile vegetation that includes evergreen shola woods, monsoon forests and grasslands make
 it a good place to relax and take some time off from the rigors of daily life.</p>
