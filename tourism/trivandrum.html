Thiruvananthapuram District (in Malayalam:തിരുവനന്തപുരം ജില്ല) is the southernmost district in the Indian state of Kerala. The district was created in 1949, with its headquarters in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, which is also Kerala's capital. The present district was created in 1956 by separating the four southernmost Taluks of the erstwhile district to form Kanyakumari district. The district is home to more than 9% of total population of the state.[2]

The district covers an area of 2,192 square kilometres (541,655 acres). At the 2019 census, it had a population of 34,545,868 ,[3] making it the second most populous district in Kerala after Malappuram district. [4] Its population density is the highest in Kerala, with 1,509 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,910/sq mi). The district is divided into six subdistricts: Thiruvananthapuram, Chirayinkeezhu, Neyyattinkara, Nedumangadu, Varkala, and Kattakada. The urban bodies in the district are the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, and the Varkala, Neyyattinkara, Attingal, and Nedumangad municipalities.

    <p class="card-text">
As you step past the gates of the Zoological Park in Thiruvananthapuram,an immediate hush falls as all the visitors collectively draw in their breath in awe. There is a furry Macaque staring right back at you while a little ahead the exotic Nilgiri Langur playfully teases you. In a few more steps it dawns on you; you are in a literal jungle, right in the heart of the city.

Said to be among the oldest of its kind in all of Asia, the zoo was built under the reign of the former ruler of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Dated to about 1857, one can still see some of the older structures that have been renovated over time. The finest avian species, brought here from around the world, dazzle your senses with an exorbitant display of colours. Throughout your walkyou are under a canopy of massive trees like mahogany, teak and fig. There is a pond at the heart of the zoo where one can view nesting Pelicans, Storks and Herons in their natural habitat.

    <p class="card-text">
The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", (City of the Divine Serpent)referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla is considered the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.
